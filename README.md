Jeffrey Neural Network Library

The mission of this library is to create a machine learning library that is applicable to all machines running python.
To use this library you must be running Python 3 and have imported the numpy, collections, and matplotlib libraries.
The current capabilities of this library are the following:
  Single Layer Neural Network Computation
  Principle Component Analysis
  K-Means computation
Future capabilities:
  Deep Learing Neural Network Computation
  Recursive Neural Network Computation

To test the the single layer neural network computation run python run_script.py [CSV file] [hidden layer size] [output layer size] [learning parameter] [iterations]
You can also run the testScript.py for a demonstration.
You may also create your own CSV file to test, it must follow the same pattern as the CTG.csv
Scripts to demonstrate the principle component analysis and k-means will be implemented
